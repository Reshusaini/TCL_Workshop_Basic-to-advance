# TCL_Workshop_Basic-to-advance
TCL Workshop_5 DAYS: Learning from  Basic of TCL basics to Advance Scripting Techniques in VLSI. IN this workshop we are going to learn to build a user Interface which will conver the constraits in .csv file to sdc format. With help of Tools Yosys and Opentimer, This user interface will generate a detailed report of the synthesized netlist and prelayout timing report.
TCL is widely used in VLSI industry for processing synthesis results, timing reports, automate the physical design flow such as floorplan, placement, and routing. 
Tcl stands for Tool Command Language. A command follow the instructions given and generate output as example, output a string, compute a math expression, or display a widget on the screen.
This strong language can cre√§te everything into the frame of a command, even programming constructs.
First understand the task and then break it to the many subtasks to learn step by step and genearte the detailed report.
