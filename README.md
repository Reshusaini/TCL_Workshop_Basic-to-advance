TCL Workshop_5 DAYS: Learning from  Basic of TCL basics to Advance Scripting Techniques in VLSI. IN this workshop we are going to learn to build a user Interface which will conver the constraits in .csv file to sdc format. With help of Tools Yosys and Opentimer, This user interface will generate a detailed report of the synthesized netlist and prelayout timing report.
TCL is widely used in VLSI industry for processing synthesis results, timing reports, automate the physical design flow such as floorplan, placement, and routing. 
Tcl stands for Tool Command Language. A command follow the instructions given and generate output as example, output a string, compute a math expression, or display a widget on the screen.

This strong language can creäte everything into the frame of a command, even programming constructs.
First understand the task and then break it to the many subtasks to learn step by step and generate the detailed report, which will be our Final output of the task.

First Task:  
Create a command TCLbox(any name) and .csv file from UNIX shell to TCL script. 
This task has three scenarios to run here which are included in this first task to create a command the TCLbox and work on .csv file
Three scenarios are here given below to understand the user behaviour in different mode.

First scenarios when user do not provide the .csv file:

Second scenarios when user give wrong  .csv file which does not exists:

Third scenarios when user ask for help to know more about the usage:

Second Task:
First Task has completed than second Task is to Convert all inputs to format [1] &SDC format, pass to synthesis tool ‘Yosys’. To complete this task we need to break down the task into subtask and deep dive into the learning skill mode.  Tasks are mentioned one by one here in the snippet to achieve the final outcome of this task.

First subtask is to creat the varibales and convert all the information available into the excel sheet. and make a matrix to make things more simpler and proceed further to create variable. 
Lets understand with help of screenshot than perform the task on VM>, with completion of the task,it will autocreate the variable.

Now Perform the task on the VM and create variables.give command ./TCLbox openMSP430_design_details.csv
here is the outcome of the  performing task on VM.
